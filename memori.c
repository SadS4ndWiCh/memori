            - `ISIG` flag generate the corresponding signal from keys.
            - `IEXTEN` flag say to terminal wait you type another key to send it 
            when you type `CTRL-V` first.
            - `BRKINT` flag say to emit a `SIGINT` signal with a break condition.
            - `INPCK` flag enables parity checking, which doesnâ€™t seem to apply 
            to modern terminal emulators.
            - `ISTRIP` flag causes the 8th bit of each input byte to be stripped, 
            meaning it will set it to 0. This is probably already turned off.
        
        `c_iflag` means `input flags` that describe other states:
            - `IXON` flag enable the `CTRL-S` and `CTRL-Q` to stop and resume 
            from receiving input respectively.
            - `ICRNL` flag translate carriage return to newline on input. [termios(3)]
        
        `c_oflag` means `output flags` that describe other states:
            - `OPOST` flag translate each newline ("\n") we print into a carriage 
            return followed by a newline ("\r\n").
        
        `c_cflag` means `contant flags` that describe some constants:
            - `CSIZE` is the character size mask. Values are `CS5`, `CS6`, `CS7` or `CS8`.
        
        To turn off some flag, you need to use bitwise operation.
